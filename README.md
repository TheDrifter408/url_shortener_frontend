## URL Shortener
The goal of this project is to create a simple URL shortener for anyone to use but the tool itself should be ready to provide analytics such as
no. of Clicks on a Link, Referrers and QR Code generation for those who need it.

## Todo:
1. Remove the Feature called 'Real Time Collaboration' as this is not a feature I will be working on. Replace it with the feature to `Archive` or `Delete` a Link.
2. Create the Dashboard following the same Design and create components accordingly that show a summary and the table of links for the user.
3. Research what sort of analytics to show in the dashboard and create those accordingly.
